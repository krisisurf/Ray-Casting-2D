# Ray-Casting-2D
Basic REAL-TIME raycasting system for 2D environment made in java. </br>
You can use (W, A, S, D) keys to move the RayCastingPointEntity or LampEntity. </br>
<sub>NOTE: A more detailed object-oriented structure might exist because the original idea wasn't exactly like it is now.</sub>

***The main things to play with are documented demonstrated in the main class ( src/environment/Launcher.java )***
